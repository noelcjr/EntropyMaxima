*PURPOSE: replace some waters with ions; which ones to replace you have to
* decide beforehand, based on random picking, low energy, ...

!ASSUMPTIONS:
! 1/ your psf and coordinates are in place
! 2/ the selection WATREPL has been defined as the water molecules
!    you want to replace in the water segment which has SEGID WAT.  
! 34/ the variable ION has to be set to the residue name of the ion in the RTF
!RESULTS: 
! A new segment named IONS will be created. Variable NIONS is set to number
! of ions in this segment.
! The water segment will have some molecules
! deleted, and the rest will be consecutively numbered. 
!USAGE EXAMPLE:
!define watrepl select segid wat .and. (resi 23 .or. resi 48 .or. resi 999) end
!set ion sod
